# Frontend Configuration

Conceptually Tauri acts as a static web host. You need to provide Tauri with a folder containing some mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript and possibly WASM that can be served to the webview Tauri provides.

Below is a checklist of common scenarios needed to integrate a frontend with Tauri:

Use static site generation (**SSG**), single-page applications (**SPA**), or classic multi-page apps (**MPA**). Tauri does not natively support server based alternatives (such as **SSR**).
For mobile development, a development server of some kind is necessary that can host the frontend on your internal IP.
Use a proper client-server relationship between your app and your APIâ€™s (no hybrid solutions with SSR).
